# Hi, my name is Steven Yuan!

I am interested in programming languages, compilers, code generation, and cross-language communication. I also write as a hobby, but my learning is a work-in-progress.

Currently, I am a graduate student at the [Full-Time Training in Anaheim](https://ftta.org). Subscribe to [my blog](https://stevenyuan.substack.com) for weekly updates on my experience!

> The Full-Time Training in Anaheim (FTTA) is a two-year program dedicated to equipping men and women for Christian service in their respective churches and communities.

Previously, I worked at AWS ([@aws](https://github.com/aws), [@awslabs](https://github.com/awslabs)) as a Software Engineer / Open Source Maintainer for [<img alt="Smithy" src="https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/raw/main/docs/_static/favicon.png" width="12">Smithy](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy).
