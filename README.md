# Hi, my name is Steven Yuan!

I am interested in programming languages, compilers, and cross-language communication. I also write as a hobby, but my learning is a work-in-progress.

Previously, I worked for @aws and @awslabs as a Software Engineer / Open Source Maintainer for [<img alt="Smithy" src="https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/raw/main/docs/_static/favicon.png" width="12">Smithy](https://github.com/awslabs/smithy).

> Smithy is a protocol-agnostic interface definition language and set of tools for generating clients, servers, and documentation for any programming language.
