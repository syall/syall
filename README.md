# Hi, my name is Steven Yuan!

I am a software engineer that is interested in, well, engineering. Though my work experience has been in traditional enterprise roles, I am also fascinated with the open source community, programming language design, and compilers. I also write to improve my technical writing skills, but it is a WIP ðŸ˜„.
